# Food Delivery Website

#Introduction

Food Delivery is the process of ordering food, for delivery or pickup, from a website or other application. The product can be either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a home-kitchen, restaurant, or a virtual restaurant) etc.

#Features

Everyone has a smartphone these days. The mobile app industry and the internet have become the next big thing thanks to the availability of online payment methods. And Online Food Ordering is no exception to them.  Some mobile apps provide plenty of features so one can easily order food within just a few swipes. Swiggy, Zomato, UberEats, etc. are a few of the best options for online food ordering.

1. Ordering Widget : An online ordering widget will allow you to accept orders through your own website by installing a small code on your web page. This will allow you to start accepting online orders on your own website, promoting your own brand, and building your customer database for future promotion. Make sure the ordering widget does not have a URL that redirects your user to a different domain. 

2. Take Away Option : Many restaurants provide Pick Up or Take Away options to their customers but they donâ€™t allow their customers to place orders through their website. Instead, the customer has to come and place the order and wait for the food to get ready. 

3. Delivery Module : A lot of restaurant owners deliver locally and all have a different pricing strategy for delivery. Some restaurants will only deliver if the order is above a certain amount. Some will deliver only in particular zones, some cake shops will deliver locally and nationally, some chocolates and sweet shops will deliver internationally, some will charge extra for particular zones or areas.
